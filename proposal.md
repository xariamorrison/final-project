# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
SNAKE

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
My project is a snake game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project will be a snake game. It will include all the features of the well-known game, including an increase in speed as the snake gets longer and a scoreboard at the top of the game. If I achieve all my goals, my game will have 2 modes: easy and hard. The easy version will contain a run-of the mills snake game without any additons, and the fruit will move all over the board in the hard version. I will have a title page, and then a brief instruction page before the game begins. After the game is lost, a score page will appear and list how many fruit the user managed to acquire. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will accomplish the basic layout and controls of the game, even if it doesn't look particularly attractive. I plan to get the game to work first (in the easy mode), before I insert GUIs. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The game will be functional with a somewhat professional and user-friendly setup (with a title and instruction page before the game starts, as well as a score that increases whenever the snake eats the fruit). It will include both the easy and hard mode.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope to interweave sound effects into the game. I may also include a "highest score" feature on the score page.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to peruse icons (cartoon snake and an apple, perhaps) that can be used in the game. I will then need to research how the snake can be moved with the keypad (unlike the turtle function, which follows predetermined movements). I will also need to research how to make the fruit bounce off the edge of the screen for the hard mode.
